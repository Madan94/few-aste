# ♻️ Fewatse - AI-Powered E-Waste Scanner  
🔍 **Identify, Analyze & Connect with Recyclers**  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project enables users to scan electronic waste and receive an **AI-powered composition analysis**, helping them understand the materials inside. It then intelligently **connects them with recyclers** for efficient disposal or reuse.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
✨ Built using the latest technologies:  
- **Flutter** - Cross-platform mobile development  
- **NodeJS** - Backend processing & API management  
- **Gemini API** - AI-driven material composition analysis  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **AI-Powered Scanning** – Detects components within e-waste  
✅ **Composition Breakdown** – Provides material analysis (metals, plastics, rare earth elements)  
✅ **Recycler Connectivity** – Suggests nearby recycling centers & connects users  
✅ **Eco-Friendly Disposal Guidance** – Educates users on responsible e-waste management  

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
Clone the repository and set up the project:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/EWasteScanner.git
cd EWasteScanner
flutter pub get
npm install
```

Run the project:  
```bash
flutter run
node server.js
```

## 🔗 API Usage  
The **Gemini API** helps analyze scanned components:  
```js
fetch("https://geminiapi.com/analyze", {
    method: "POST",
    body: JSON.stringify({ image: scannedImage }),
    headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
}).then(res => res.json()).then(data => console.log(data));
```

## 🌍 Sustainability Impact  
By **reducing improper disposal** and **enhancing recycling efficiency**, this project helps:  
♻️ Lower environmental damage  
🔋 Optimize rare material reuse  
💡 Educate users about e-waste hazards
